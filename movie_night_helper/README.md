# Movie Night Helper 

This app uses the Online Movie Database API through 
[rapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub). You select the
genre that you'd like to see, as well as how large the
movie pool is from where the app pulls its recommendation from
(e.g. top-50 from the genre thriller).

The app simply pulls a random movie from the selected
movie pool and shows some relevant info, such as title,
year, imdb/metacritic ratings, runtime, as well as the
movie poster.

Since Heroku has gotten rid of its free hosting of projects
I have yet to find a nice place to host this app.
